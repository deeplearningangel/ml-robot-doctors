## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR IMAGE GENERATION

1. **Consistency Across Images:**
   - Save your best images of each robot character
   - Reference them in subsequent prompts: "In the same style as [previous image]"
   - Keep character designs consistent (same colors, same features)

2. **Batch Processing:**
   - Generate all Dr. Logic images in one session
   - Then all Dr. Tree images
   - Then all Dr. Neural images
   - This helps maintain visual consistency

3. **Iteration Strategy:**
   - Generate 3-4 variations of each prompt
   - Pick the best one that matches your vision
   - Use image-to-image if you need refinements

4. **Platform-Specific Adjustments:**
   - **DALL-E 3:** Very literal, use detailed descriptions
   - **Midjourney:** Loves artistic keywords like "stunning," "cinematic"
   - **Stable Diffusion:** Benefits from negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements

5. **Negative Prompts** (what to avoid):
   - Dark, scary, threatening, aggressive
   - Realistic human anatomy (keep it cartoon/stylized)
   - Overly complex, cluttered, chaotic
   - Sad, depressing, clinical coldness
